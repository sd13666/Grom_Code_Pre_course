      <p>The float CSS property places an element on the left or right side of its container,
        allowing text and inline elements to wrap around it. The element is removed from the normal
        flow of the page, though still remaining a part of the flow (in contrast to absolute
        positioning). As mentioned above, when an element is floated, it is taken out of the normal
        flow of the document (though still remaining part of it). It is shifted to the left, or
        right, until it touches the edge of its containing box, or another floated element. In this
        example, there are three colored squares. Two are floated left, and one is floated right.
        Note that the second "left" square is placed to the right of the first. Additional squares
        would continue to stack to the right, until they filled the containing box, after which they
        would wrap to the next line.</p>
